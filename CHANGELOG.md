**What's New in 2.5.1 (latest legacy)**

* Improving typings.
* Add eslint and prettier for code cleaning.
* Upgrade devDependencies.

**What's New in 2.5.0**

* As the same with `2.4.1`, but rollback `crypto-js` dependency to version `3.3.0` to maintain compatibility with environment that does not support native crypto module.

**What's New in 2.4.2**

* Removed empty string check to allow decryption and encryption on empty string (as suggested by [@TransmissionsDev](https://github.com/TransmissionsDev) on [issue#21](https://github.com/danang-id/simple-crypto-js/issues/21)).

**What's New in 2.4.1**

* Fix a bug on type detection mechanism where a string that begins with number detected as number when decryption, thus cutting the rest of the string result (thanks [@TransmissionsDev](https://github.com/TransmissionsDev)).

**What's New in 2.4.0**

* Added data type detection. Decryption process will now return data with its proper data type. For now, object, string, number and boolean are supported.
* Added `append()` and `update()` functions, both to append and update the data buffer respectively.
* Added overload functions for `decrpyt()` and `encrypt()`.
* Added initial support for encoding (see static variable `SimpleCrypto.encoders`). However, for now, it only supports UTF-8 even if you set another encoder.
* Added chaining functions support. Functions that initially have no return, like `append()`, `update()`, `setSecret()`, `setEncoder()`, now will returning its instance.
* Added static function `SimpleCrypto.generateRandomString()` and `SimpleCrypto.generateRandomWordArray()`.

**What's New in 2.3.1**

* Fix npm dependencies security audit.

**What's New in 2.3.0**

* Fix chosen cipher text attacks vulnerability (thanks [@paragonie-scott](https://github.com/paragonie-scott) and [@adi928](https://github.com/adi928)).
* Upgrade [crypto-js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) to version 4.0.0.
* Fix security risk in dev dependencies by upgrading them.

**What's New in 2.2.0**

* Fix CDN release, setting webpack output as UMD with default library name of SimpleCrypto.
* CDN now have two files you may use, the distribution file and minified distribution one.

**What's New in 2.1.3**

* Fix jsDelivr link

**What's New in 2.1.2**

* Update missing file in NPM release.

**What's New in 2.1.0**

* Update dependency.
* Fix missing web bundler as distribution build tool for the Web (using webpack).

**What's New in 2.0.2**

* Bugs fixed.
* Remove gulp.

**What's New in 2.0.1**

* Add coverage service.

**What's New in 2.0.0**

* Using only these functions to encrypt or decrypt: `encrypt()` and `decrypt()` (accepts string, object, number, or boolean data type). Function `encryptObject()` and `decryptObject()` is in deprecation as these functions are enough.
* Securing instance's properties from public access. Access to instance properties, like `instance.secret`, is not allowed anymore.
* New TypeScript definition file of this library is now available.
* Fixed documentation (typos, diction, etc).
* For contributors: Using `mocha`, `chai` and `coveralls` to create full unit-testing of the library. You could see testing result on top of this README.
* For contributors: Using `gulp` to compile the TypeScript source code into JavaScript ES5.
