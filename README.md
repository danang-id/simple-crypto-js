**_SimpleCrypto_** is a JavaScript library that simplify the process of encryption and decryption of JavaScript objects, as simple as just calling `encrypt()` and `decrypt()` function. This library implements brix's [crypto-js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) library. This library is pure JavaScript library built with TypeScript targeting CommonJS ECMAScript 5 (ES5), so it is compatible with most NodeJS back-end applications or JavaScript front-end (client browser).

## Breaking Changes

**v2.3.0: New Algorithm**

SimpleCrypto v2.3.0 onward will use a new algorithm, because the older one was vulnerable to chosen cipher attack. Any **data that encrypted using v2.2.0 and earlier will NOT be able to be decrypted using v2.3.0 onward**; vice versa: data encrypted using v2.3.0 onward will NOT be able to be decrypted using v2.2.0 and earlier.

## What's New?

**What's New in 2.5.1 (latest legacy)**

* Improving typings.
* Add eslint and prettier for code cleaning.
* Upgrade devDependencies.

**What's New in 2.5.0**

* As the same with `2.4.1`, but rollback `crypto-js` dependency to version `3.3.0` to maintain compatibility with environment that does not support native crypto module.

For full change-log, please refer to [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Getting Started

This library is available through [jsDelivr CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-crypto-js@legacy/dist/SimpleCrypto.min.js) and package manager (like [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) or [yarn](https://www.yarnpkg.com/)).

### Vanilla JavaScript + HTML

To get started, add SimpleCrypto script to your HTML page. **Only legacy version of SimpleCrypto is supported.**

```html
<head>
    <!-- Another line -->
    <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-crypto-js@legacy/dist/SimpleCrypto.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Another line -->
</head>
```

Then, your script section, you may use `SimpleCrypto` as Class to create a new SimpleCrypto instance.

```html
<body>
    <!-- Another line -->
    <script lang="js">
        var simpleCrypto = new SimpleCrypto("a very secret key")
        <!-- Do your cryptographic logic here  -->
    </script>
    <!-- Another line -->
</body>
```

### NodeJS

If you are using NodeJS, add `simple-crypto-js` as your project dependency.

```bash
# If you're using NPM
npm install --save simple-crypto-js

# If you're using Yarn
yarn add simple-crypto-js
```

Then, include **_SimpleCrypto_** your project.

```javascript
var SimpleCrypto = require("simple-crypto-js").default
```

If you are using Babel or TypeScript that support import statement, you could go that way.

```javascript
import SimpleCrypto from "simple-crypto-js"
```

## How to Use SimpleCrypto

Full documentation about **_SimpleCrypto_** API is [available here](https://simplecrypto.js.org/docs).

## Built With

Written in [TypeScript](https://typscriptlang.org/), built into ECMAScript 5 using the TypeScript compiler and webpack bundler.

## Contribution

To contribute, simply fork this project, and issue a pull request. However, before issuing a pull request, you have to make sure that your changes will not break current API, its parameter and its expected output.

You may test your changes by running the test script.

```bash
npm run test
```

If all tests were passed, you are good to go.
